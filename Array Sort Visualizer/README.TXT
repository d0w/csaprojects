This scenario is intended mainly to demonstrate the ArrayDisplay class.

Class 'ArrayDisplay' can show an array of elements visually on screen, and animate changes to the
array. The changes that can be animated are moves of elements to changed positions, removal of elements
and additions of elements.

As a demo, this scenario creates an array (alternatively an array of simple bars or an array of animals)
and implements Bubble sort on the array. By having the visualiser in the world, the array changes 
are automatically animated.

It's probably most interesting to use the functions interactively (not using the Act and Run buttons).

Right-click on the world background to

 - create an array
 - run Bubble sort
 
 If you want to use this as an exercise implementing sorting algorithms, you need to work only in the 
 MyWorld class.
